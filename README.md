# Project Title: 
## Caching Proxy Server Implementation

### Description
Developed a caching proxy server in Python to improve network performance by caching frequently accessed web resources. 
The proxy intercepts HTTP requests from clients, checks if the requested resource is in the cache, and serves it from 
the cache if available. If not, it forwards the request to the origin server, caches the response, and returns it to the
client. Implemented functionalities include parsing HTTP requests, caching responses, handling various HTTP status 
codes, and managing concurrent client connections.

### Technologies and Skills
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries/Modules: Socket programming, urllib.parse, pathlib
- Concepts: HTTP protocol, caching mechanisms, networking, concurrency
- Tools: Command-line interface, debugging

### Achievements and Contributions:
- Implemented parsing functions to extract method, URL, and version from HTTP requests.
- Developed caching mechanisms to store and retrieve HTTP responses efficiently.
- Enhanced error handling to manage various HTTP status codes and exceptions.
- Documented project details and provided clear comments for future reference and collaboration.

### Impact:
- Significantly improved network performance by reducing latency and bandwidth usage for frequently accessed web resources.
- Demonstrated problem-solving skills by addressing challenges such as handling malformed requests and managing cache consistency.
- Enhanced understanding of networking concepts and web architecture through hands-on implementation and troubleshooting.

### Future Enhancements:
- Implement support for HTTPS connections to handle secure web traffic.
- Enhance cache management strategies to optimize space utilization and eviction policies.
- Implement logging and monitoring functionalities to track server performance and cache hit rates.
- Optimize performance by supporting concurrent client connections using threading.
